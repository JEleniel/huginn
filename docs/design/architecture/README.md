## How to Use These Documents

### For Developers

1. Start with **System_Architecture.md** to understand the overall design
2. Read relevant requirement documents for your area of work
3. Refer to **Plugin_System.md** if working on plugins
4. Check **NFRs.md** for quality standards to meet
5. Review **Deployment_Architecture.md** for deployment considerations

### For Architects

1. Review all requirement documents to understand functional scope
2. Study **System_Architecture.md** for design decisions
3. Examine **NFRs.md** for quality attributes
4. Assess **Deployment_Architecture.md** for operational concerns

### For Project Managers

1. Review requirement documents for scope understanding
2. Check **NFRs.md** for quality standards
3. Use these documents to:
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Plan releases
   - Assign work
   - Track progress

### For Security Reviewers

1. Read **Requirement_5.md** for security requirements
2. Review security sections in **System_Architecture.md**
3. Check **NFRs.md** security requirements
4. Examine **Deployment_Architecture.md** security hardening

## Machine Agent Documentation

Implementation tracking for automated agents:

- **[../agents/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](../agents/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Current implementation status
- **[../agents/TODO.md](../agents/TODO.md)** - Detailed implementation plan

## Document Conventions

### Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ Complete
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚è≥ Not Started
- üîÆ Future/Planned
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked/Issues

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Must have for basic functionality
- **High**: Important for usability
- **Medium**: Enhances user experience
- **Low**: Nice to have features

### Requirement References

Requirements are cross-referenced throughout documentation:
- `Requirement N.M` refers to requirement documents
- `NFR-XX-N` refers to non-functional requirements
- Diagrams use Mermaid markdown syntax

## Maintenance

These documents should be updated when:
- Requirements change
- Architecture evolves
- New features are added
- Design decisions are made

Keep architecture documentation in sync with code through regular reviews.

## Additional Resources

- [Implementation Plan](../Implementation.md) - Detailed implementation phases
- [Design Overview](../README.md) - High-level design summary
- [Project README](../../../README.md) - Project overview

## Questions or Feedback

For questions about the architecture or to suggest improvements:
1. Review existing documentation first
2. Check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide
3. Open an issue with the `architecture` label
4. Discuss in architecture review meetings
