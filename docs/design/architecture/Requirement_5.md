# Requirement 5: Security & Privilege Management

## Overview

Huginn must implement robust security measures and proper privilege management to ensure safe operation while providing necessary capabilities for network scanning. The system must follow security best practices, minimize attack surface, and provide clear guidance on privilege requirements.

## User Story

As a security-conscious administrator, I need Huginn to operate with the minimum privileges necessary, provide clear warnings about security implications, and follow security best practices. I want to understand what privileges are required for each scan type and have confidence that the tool won't introduce vulnerabilities into my environment.

## Features

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege (Priority: Critical)

- **Fallback Operations**: Use unprivileged alternatives when possible

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Scanner checks privileges before running scans
- Scans requiring unavailable privileges produce clear errors
- Errors suggest privilege requirements and alternatives
