# Non-Functional Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the Huginn cyber threat scanning toolkit. These requirements define the quality attributes, constraints, and standards that the system must meet to ensure it is performant, secure, maintainable, and usable.

## Performance Requirements

### PR-1: Scan Performance

**Requirement**: The scanner must efficiently process large numbers of targets without significant degradation.

**Metrics**:

- Process at least 100 targets per minute for basic scans (ping, TCP connect)
- Support concurrent scanning of at least 10 targets simultaneously
- Memory usage must remain stable (no memory leaks) during extended operation
- CPU usage should not exceed 80% on a single core during normal operations

**Rationale**: Security professionals need to scan large networks efficiently without dedicating excessive resources.

### PR-2: Startup Time

**Requirement**: Application startup time must be minimal.

**Metrics**:

- Cold start time: < 2 seconds from invocation to first scan
- Configuration loading: < 500ms for typical configuration files
- Plugin initialization: < 1 second for all built-in plugins

**Rationale**: Quick startup is essential for ad-hoc security assessments and scripting.

### PR-3: Response Time

**Requirement**: Interactive commands must provide responsive feedback.

**Metrics**:

- Command-line argument parsing: < 100ms
- Progress updates: At least every 5 seconds during long operations
- Help text display: < 200ms
- Configuration validation: < 1 second

**Rationale**: Good user experience requires immediate feedback for interactive operations.

### PR-4: Resource Efficiency

**Requirement**: The scanner must operate efficiently with minimal resource consumption.

**Metrics**:

- Memory footprint: < 100MB for typical scans (< 1000 targets)
- Binary size: < 20MB (stripped release build)
- File descriptor usage: Properly close all resources
- Network bandwidth: Respect configurable rate limits

**Rationale**: Scanner should run on resource-constrained systems and not overwhelm networks.

## Scalability Requirements

### SC-1: Target Scalability

**Requirement**: Support scanning from single hosts to large networks.

**Metrics**:

- Minimum: Single target
- Standard: 1-1000 targets
- Large-scale: 1000-10000 targets
- Maximum: 65536 targets (full /16 network)

**Rationale**: Different use cases require different scales, from single-host checks to full network scans.

### SC-2: Concurrent Operations

**Requirement**: Scale concurrent operations based on available resources.

**Metrics**:

- Configurable concurrency: 1-1000 concurrent scans
- Default concurrency: 10 concurrent scans
- Auto-scaling: Adjust based on system resources (future)

**Rationale**: Maximize throughput while preventing resource exhaustion.

### SC-3: Plugin Scalability

**Requirement**: Support multiple scan plugins without performance degradation.

**Metrics**:

- Built-in plugins: 7 plugins initially
- Plugin limit: No hard limit on plugin count
- Plugin overhead: < 10ms per plugin registration

**Rationale**: Extensibility is a core feature; system must handle many plugins efficiently.

## Reliability Requirements

### RL-1: Availability

**Requirement**: Scanner must be reliable and available when needed.

**Metrics**:

- Crash rate: < 0.1% of scan operations
- Graceful degradation: Continue operation despite individual scan failures
- Recovery: Automatic recovery from transient errors

**Rationale**: Security scanning is critical; failures could miss vulnerabilities.

### RL-2: Error Handling

**Requirement**: All errors must be handled gracefully without crashing.

**Metrics**:

- No panics in production code (unless unrecoverable)
- All errors logged with context
- Clear error messages for users
- Error recovery paths tested

**Rationale**: Robust error handling prevents data loss and user confusion.

### RL-3: Data Integrity

**Requirement**: Scan results must be accurate and consistent.

**Metrics**:

- Result accuracy: 99.9% accurate port detection
- No data corruption: Serialization round-trips correctly
- Deterministic results: Same scan produces same results (within network variance)

**Rationale**: Incorrect results could lead to security vulnerabilities being missed.

## Security Requirements

### SE-1: Code Safety

**Requirement**: Codebase must be memory-safe and free of undefined behavior.

**Metrics**:

- Zero unsafe code blocks (`#[forbid(unsafe_code)]`)
- Zero memory leaks detected by testing
- All dependencies audited for vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits passed

**Rationale**: Security tool must not introduce vulnerabilities itself.

### SE-2: Privilege Management

**Requirement**: Operate with minimum necessary privileges.

**Metrics**:

- Document privilege requirements for each scan type
- Support capability-based permissions (Linux)
- Drop privileges after initialization when possible
- Warn on unnecessary privilege elevation

**Rationale**: Following principle of least privilege reduces risk.

### SE-3: Input Validation

**Requirement**: All inputs must be validated and sanitized.

**Metrics**:

- 100% of user inputs validated
- No command injection vulnerabilities
- No path traversal vulnerabilities
- Fuzzing tests pass

**Rationale**: Prevent injection attacks and malicious inputs.

### SE-4: Audit Logging

**Requirement**: Security-relevant events must be logged.

**Metrics**:

- All scans logged with timestamp and target
