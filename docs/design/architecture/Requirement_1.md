# Requirement 1: Core Scanning System

## Overview

The Huginn cyber threat scanning toolkit must provide a robust, efficient, and extensible core scanning system capable of performing multiple types of network security scans. The system should be built using Rust 2024 edition with strict safety guarantees (no unsafe code) and support asynchronous, concurrent scanning operations.

## User Story

As a security administrator, I need a reliable tool to scan network hosts and services to identify potential security vulnerabilities and assess system availability. I want the scanner to be fast, accurate, and capable of running multiple scan types simultaneously without overwhelming network resources.

## Features

### 1. Core Scanner Engine (Priority: Critical)

A central orchestration engine that manages scan execution, coordinates plugins, and aggregates results.

**Feature Detail:**

- **Scanner Initialization**: Create a Scanner instance from configuration that validates settings and registers available plugins
- **Concurrent Execution**: Use Tokio async runtime to execute multiple scans concurrently across targets
- **Resource Management**: Implement rate limiting and connection pooling to prevent network flooding
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle network errors, timeouts, and partial failures without aborting entire scan operations
- **Result Aggregation**: Collect and consolidate results from all enabled plugins into unified output

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Scanner compiles with zero unsafe code blocks
- Scanner can execute at least 3 concurrent scans per target without resource exhaustion
- Failed scans for individual targets do not cause other scans to fail
- Results are collected and presented in a structured format (JSON, text)
- Scanner logs all significant events (start, completion, errors) with appropriate severity levels

### 2. Asynchronous Network Operations (Priority: Critical)

All network operations must be non-blocking and leverage async/await patterns for maximum efficiency.

**Feature Detail:**

- **Async Runtime**: Use Tokio runtime for all I/O operations
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts per scan type with default values
- **Connection Management**: Proper cleanup of network resources after scan completion
- **Cancellation Support**: Ability to cancel running scans gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All network I/O uses async/await patterns
- Timeouts are enforced for all network operations
- Network resources (sockets, connections) are properly closed
- Scanner responds to shutdown signals within 2 seconds

### 3. Target Management (Priority: High)

Support for scanning single hosts, multiple hosts, IP ranges, and targets from files.

**Feature Detail:**

- **Target Parsing**: Accept targets in various formats:
	- Single IP: `192.168.1.1`
	- Hostname: `example.com`
	- IP range: `192.168.1.0/24`
	- Multiple targets: comma-separated or from file
- **Target Validation**: Validate target formats before scanning
- **Target Enumeration**: Expand IP ranges and CIDR notation to individual targets

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Scanner accepts targets as command-line arguments, configuration file, or input file
- Invalid target formats produce clear error messages
- CIDR notation is properly expanded (e.g., /24 to 254 hosts)
- Scanner handles DNS resolution failures gracefully

### 4. Result Collection and Reporting (Priority: High)

Comprehensive collection and presentation of scan results in multiple formats.

**Feature Detail:**

- **Result Structure**: Define ScanResult type with:
	- Target identifier (IP/hostname)
	- Scan type performed
	- Status (success, failure, timeout)
	- Details (port states, service info, errors)
	- Timestamp
- **Output Formats**: Support multiple output formats:
	- Human-readable text
	- JSON for programmatic consumption
	- CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- **Summary Statistics**: Aggregate statistics:
	- Total targets scanned
	- Success/failure counts
	- Execution time
	- Open/closed port counts

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Results include all required fields (target, type, status, details, timestamp)
- JSON output is valid and parseable
- Text output is readable and well-formatted
- Summary statistics are accurate
- Results are ordered consistently (by target, then by scan type)

### 5. Progress Reporting (Priority: Medium)

Real-time feedback on scan progress for long-running operations.

**Feature Detail:**

- **Progress Indicators**: Display:
	- Current target being scanned
	- Percentage complete
	- Estimated time remaining
	- Success/failure counts
- **Verbosity Levels**: Support different verbosity:
	- Quiet: Only errors and final summary
	- Normal: Progress updates every N targets
	- Verbose: Detailed per-target results
	- Debug: All internal operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Progress updates appear at least every 5 seconds for long scans
- Progress indicators do not interfere with result output
- Verbosity level is configurable via command-line or config
- Debug mode includes internal state information

### 6. Performance Optimization (Priority: Medium)

Ensure scanner performs efficiently even with large numbers of targets.

**Feature Detail:**

- **Concurrency Tuning**: Configurable parallelism level
- **Memory Management**: Bounded result buffers to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections where applicable
- **Batch Processing**: Process targets in batches to control resource usage

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Scanner handles 1000+ targets without crashing
- Memory usage remains stable during long scans
- Configurable concurrency level (default: 10 concurrent targets)
- CPU usage is reasonable (no busy loops, proper async waiting)

### 7. Error Recovery (Priority: Medium)

Robust error handling that allows scans to continue despite individual failures.

**Feature Detail:**

- **Partial Failure Handling**: Continue scanning remaining targets if some fail
- **Retry Logic**: Optional retry for transient failures (e.g., temporary network issues)
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages with context
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to simpler scan methods if preferred method fails

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Single target failure does not abort entire scan run
- Errors include context (target, scan type, reason)
- Retry attempts are logged
- Final report includes both successes and failures

## Dependencies

- Tokio async runtime
- Log facade for logging
- Serde for result serialization
- Configuration system (see Requirement 3)
- Plugin system (see Requirement 2)

## Testing Requirements
